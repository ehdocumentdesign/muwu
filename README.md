# muwu - Markup Writeup

compile markdown files from a human-readable outline

## About Muwu

Muwu was created in response to dissatisfaction with commercial word processors, particularly the poor support for exporting to HTML.

  - Muwu starts with the outline.
    - Easy to rearrange your project.
    - Develop your project using smaller, manageable files.
    - Organize your project to your needs.
    - Use your favorite text editor!
  - Muwu can make a table of contents.
    - Hyperlink your document.
    - Automatic section numbering.
  - Muwu reads Markdown.
    - Simple syntax.
    - Focus on the text now, save the formatting for later!
  - Muwu reads Haml.
    - Just in case Markdown isn't enough.
  - Muwu reads YAML.
    - Simple syntax for the project outline, project metadata, and project options.
  - Muwu writes HTML5 and CSS3.
    - Flexible rendering for screen and print media.
    - Does not use inline `style=` attributes.

Maybe you don't know the page size for which a work will be destined. Maybe there is no page. Maybe a project is still deep in development, and it's too soon to be thinking about fonts, formatting, margins, spacing, and styles. Maybe *what-you-see-is-what-you-get* is not *what you want*.
